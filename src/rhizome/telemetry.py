"""rhizome telemetry — thin glue over the gnomon shared core.

All schema / connect / record / stats / Tee / cap constants live in the shared
`gnomon` core (identical `calls` schema across the-orrery tools, so ledgers can
be unioned for cross-tool analysis). This module re-exports the public surface
rhizome callers expect, binding rhizome's Cfg once so call sites don't pass it.

rhizome is an argparse CLI (not Typer/Click), so it uses the `record` posture —
`cli.run()` owns the capture loop itself (mirrors docket.cli.run_wrapped) rather
than gnomon.run_instrumented's in-process Click wrapper. Only
record/stats/db_path/connect/Tee/caps are needed here.
