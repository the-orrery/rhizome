"""rhizome capture — low-friction fleeting-thought inbox.

  rhizome capture <text ...>        # words joined into one line
  echo "..." | rhizome capture      # or pipe the thought via stdin

A fleeting thought is not yet knowledge. The write bars for a §存 note
(`rhizome new`, 5-field frontmatter, a domain) and a docket issue are
deliberately high; there was no low-bar slot for "jot this before it's gone".
`capture` fills that slot: one timestamped line appended to a plain-Markdown
inbox, then triaged later into `rhizome new` / docket and deleted.

This is `capture (raw)` in ADR-022 terms — raw, out of the KB boundary, NOT a
note and NOT indexed. The default inbox lives under `~/.config/rhizome/`, which
has no `INDEX.md`, so it is structurally outside every domain.
